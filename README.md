# Voxellian
This repository contains the source code for Voxellian, a voxel-based
role-playing game for Apple platforms.

## Platform Support
The game is intended to support, in the following order of priority:

1. macOS 
2. iPadOS
3. iOS 
4. visionOS (iPad compatibility mode)

Apple TV support is out of scope, and would require dealing with particularly
frustrating limitations with storage. It also seems that Apple may be
abandoning the TV so it's not particularly important.

homeOS, watchOS are out of scope... lol

## Repository Structure
This repository contains all first-party libraries, tools, and the game
executable itself.

This repository does not contain:

- Game Design Document (go to Obsidian)
- Game Writing Drafts / Planning docs (go to Scrivener)

The goal will be to make Voxellian source-available or open-source in the
future, after an initial final release, possibly time-delayed. The goal will
also be to release any supplemental resources created during development. I
would like people to be able to experiment with the game and learn how it was
implemented.
