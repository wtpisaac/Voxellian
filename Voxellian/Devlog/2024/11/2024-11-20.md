#  Devlog: 2024-11-20: Beginning Development

I figure it might be prudent to keep a log of development in the repository
itself, and so my intent is to do that here via these Markdown files. I might
come to regret that later if I want to publish these in a more accessible 
manner, but these will probably be fairly technical and most primarily useful
to myself, followed by enthusiasts or potential contributors down the line.

I've never embarked on a project of this scale, so I suspect there will be some
pains I encounter, and I may not finish the project. That's OK, and my hope is
that even for an incomplete project I can learn some technologies. I also should
disclose I have not worked on any major game before. It's likely that this 
project will not succeed. I won't be calling attention to this project
unless I happen to make decent progress towards its completion. If things
go wrong, hopefully this serves as a nice artifact of code and thought process
for people to be able to refer to.

With all that, here's my thoughts so far as I ruminate on tasks:

## Game Design
I am working on the Game Design Document for Voxellian currently. I have not 
yet published this, and I may not until the game is complete (or abandoned).

Writing the game design document has been pretty challenging but rewarding.
It's easy to visualize a game in your head, but a lot more difficult to try and
enumerate out the mechanics of it. I do not yet have a full picture of what the
mechanics of the game will look like.

I got inspired to at least attempt to write a GDD thanks to Pirate Software.
If this game ever actually goes anywhere, or even if it doesn't, really 
grateful for the motivation to try and tackle a project. Writing the GDD is
honestly very helpful trying to nail down the potential requirements of the
game's mechanics.

Broadly speaking, I want to try and merge the voxel sandbox genre with the
story-driven RPG genre. Beyond these two elements, my hope is to incorporate
elements of horror that give the game a distinct feel. As a stretch goal,
I would like the game to contain some amount of dynamic elements which provide
open-ended gameplay opportunities, though I think those are most likely to be
watered down / cut, since it requires doing a half-decent job of procedural
generation, whereas anything else can be hand-made and tailored.

Non-goals are:

- Multiplayer. Way too much for a first game (this is already too much) and
not likely to mesh well with all of the mechanics I want to create, such as
allowing the player to terraform the world.
- Stunning graphics. I am not an artist. I am not a graphics programmer.
- Dynamic animations. The gameplay will likely resemble an old-school MMO or
RPG, where the animations are more representative of actions taking place,
rather than intending to directly represent the action. The combat will not
be as smooth as a Souls game.
- Voice acting. I do not know anyone who can do voice acting. The game's
dialogue will be text-based.
- Stunning soundtrack. I will probably try and make some sort of soundtrack
for the game, but music is not my forte and that will be yet another learning
experience for me.
- Proper plugin/modding support. To be honest, I don't know what this would
entail until I build out a game and can see where hooks would need to be
injected. There is also limited utility in doing this given the lack of
multiplayer (where plugins are most useful). At some point I will probably
release this game under an App Store compatible copyleft license such as the
Mozilla Public License, so that should allow people to make total conversions
of the game (or ship other games with its engine), and I may try and create 
tools within the game to extend its content without programming modifications.
- Enterprise-level testing. I work with TCA at my job. It's not going to be
appropriate here.
- Reusable architecture. The "engine" and the "game" here will probably not be
the most separated concerns-wise. It is likely the code here will not be worth
reusing, and a sequel would need to be rewritten to support more platforms
anyways, so let's just build something.
- Perfect code. It doesn't exist. This project is recreational and I don't know
what I am doing. There will be many mistakes.

I'm continuing work on the Game Design Document currently. At some point I may
take an archive of it and put it into this repository. Right now I am still
fleshing out what my vision of the world looks like, and I suspect this will
go on for some time before I want to put a copy of the document somewhere open.
So for now I am keeping it to myself.

## Initial Research
Right now, I am focusing on researching various bits and bobs for the game.
I think the immediate priority will be to write some core logic (e.g. logging),
with the first order of business after some core components being prototyping a
voxel world. 

### Swift Concurrency vs GCD
A first architectural question is whether Swift Concurrency will be suitable
for use in the game. It isn't entirely clear to me, but I have some hunches.

In favor of Swift Concurrency:

- It's the new standard for the language, and something I need to learn for my
day job. Even if it's not the best for games, it may make sense to use it for
this project.
- There are
[custom executors for actors](https://github.com/swiftlang/swift-evolution/blob/main/proposals/0392-custom-actor-executors.md),
which if I read correctly, implies one may control the actual thread
destinations for asynchronous operations. If this is true, this might allow
the necessary level of controls for performance tuning while keeping to
async/await API design.
- I suspect I am not going to be brilliant at scheduling, and it is entirely
likely Apple's engineering team knows how to write a scheduler better than I
could trying to use threads manually. (The vagueness with which I write this is
a pretty good indication of how little I know here).

Against it:

- There may be too much indirection, and this may result in ending up with
badly designed code that performs too poorly. Mainly, I worry about
inconsistent performance, where frame times become hard to predict.
This may (?) not matter if we put most gameplay relevant logic on the main
thread, and keep multithreaded concerns to what makes sense to multithread.
- If Swift is determining where to schedule jobs, I wonder about the cache
coherence in that scenario. It's possible adopting Swift Concurrency will
leave performance on the table due to unideal context switching.
- If we end up needing to manually manage what threads tasks end up on, do
we end up just using GCD with extra steps? Is there really more safety and
if so, is that even critical for a game that is not running over the network?

I will probably start with async/await, but will be keeping an eye on it and
trying to learn how to analyze the performance implications. If the game ends
up with unacceptable or unacceptably inconsistent performance, I expect I may
need to refactor towards GCD.

### Model I/O, PHASE, other Apple frameworks
Apple seems to ship a lot of useful frameworks for game development, and since
cross-platform support for other platforms is a non-goal, it probably makes
sense to adopt their technologies where useful.

Most promising:
- [PHASE](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/phase/) appears to offer
 sophisticated audio processing for 3D environments, given they conform to
 Model I/O. If this is usable, it may provide a relatively good option for
 audio in the game.
- [Model I/O](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/modelio) provides
some standard methods for working with meshes, and crucially relating to the
above, seems to provide a model for the audio engine to interoperate with
mesh data. If this is so, we probably want to maximize use of Model I/O
and have our generated meshes conform to this system's standards.
- SwiftUI may be useful for the user interface of the game. It probably needs
to be customized heavily however, so this needs to be kept in mind. Any usage
of SwiftUI would be in a layer atop the Metal rendering of the game itself.
- Jury out on GameplayKit for now. I do not know if this framework has been
sufficiently updated. RealityKit offers similar functionality but tied to a
particular high-level renderer that I do not necessarily want to work with,
and may be fairly coupled to Vision Pro and other use cases I don't yet have
hardware to work with (nor game design to justify compatibility).

### Graphics
I've been reviewing some math for graphics. Some useful resources:
- [3D Math Primer for Graphics and Game Development](https://gamemath.com/)
is a good textbook for vectors, linear algebra, basic physics; I've been
following this and trying to absorb information from it.
- [This lecture on matrices](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQ60rFwh2ig) on
Computerphile is quite good.
- I picked up a copy of Real Time Rendering, Game Engine Architecture, and some
other books. I haven't gone through much of them yet, and I doubt I will be
adopting most graphics techniques for this game, but they are cool to refer to
and I'll try to relay any insights from them I incorporate into this game.

## Initial Technical Tasks
Off the top of my head:

- Logging is probably crucial and I should start working on a simple logging
framework first.
- I need to get a prototype of voxels which can be created, destroyed, and have
at least basic lighting + textures, which can reside in-memory. This can be 
a jumping off point for experimentation.
